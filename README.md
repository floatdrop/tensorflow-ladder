Implementation of the Ladder network algorithm. I wrote this as an exercise when learning TensorFlow, and I never got really good results with it. I leave it here as an inspiration to others, but be warned that this may not be a good reference for neither Ladder network nor idiomatic TensorFlow code.

The code is based on the following:

- The paper [_Semi-Supervised Learning with Ladder Networks_](http://arxiv.org/abs/1507.02672) by A Rasmus, H Valpola, M Honkala,
M Berglund, and T Raiko.
- [Theano implementation](https://github.com/CuriousAI/ladder) used in the above paper
